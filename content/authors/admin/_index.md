    #summary: |
     # I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the #significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural #networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; #and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Interested in cognitive neuroscience, magnetic resonance imaging, and ethics. I am interested in learning about the biological substrates of cognition through neurophysiology. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Dr. Eduardo Garza-Villarreal's lab with a TMS therapeutic intervention project with neuropsychological, fMRI-task, and EEG assessments. Fond of music, physics, and technology. Medical doctor graduated from the University of Sonora, Master of Science (neurobiology) from UNAM and PhD student in biomedical sciences at INB-UNAM.
